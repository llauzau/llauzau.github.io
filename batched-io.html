<h2 class="u-text--hanging u-push__top--xl">The Problem</h2>
<p>
    Many mid-size print shops use a very manual and complex process, which often
    relies on the knowledge of just a few individuals to keep everything running smoothly.
    Innovative Labeling Solutions(ILS) and AMEND came to our team with an idea to build a digital
    system that would allow for real-time schedule planning. The pair wanted to create a high-fidelity
    prototype to validate their idea at an upcoming trade show in orderto determine the
    product-market fit and gauge interest before investing significant time and funds in moving it
    forward.

<h2>Design Process</h2>
<h3>Discovery</h3>
<p>
    We kicked off the project by touring the print shop in order to better understand the process
    we were going to try and streamline with the prototype. We conducted user interviews with the
    floor scheduler, press operators, and a sales rep and then took our notes and organized them
    into a user story-map.
</p>
<h3 class="u-text--hanging u-push__top--lg">Team & Role </h3>
<p>
    I co-lead this project with another designer. We split facilitation user research, wire-framing
    with clients, UX/UI design decisions, and HTML & CSS implementation.
</p>
<h3 class="u-push__top--lg">User Flows & Wireframing</h3>
<p>
    In order to build the prototype, we identified as the most important screen in the app and mapped
    out our user flows. The wire-framing process was very collaborative between our team and the client,
    working side-by-side at a whiteboard which allowed for fast-feedback.

<h3>User Interface Design</h3>
<p>
    The objective of the interface was to visualize the schedule of the entire press floor for 23-hours.
    We wanted a holistic view of the press floor­—which machines are scheduled, how long each job is
    scheduled to run, and if jobs are ahead or behind schedule. Key data-points were called out across
    the top of the screen for sales and other front office users.
