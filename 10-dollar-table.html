    I worked on a 12-week website pilot called $10 Table. The idea was that customers would
    be sent ten recipes each week that can feed a family of 4 for $10 or less. For this pilot,
    I was responsible for all the creative work which included branding, designs for a responsive
    site, and weekly email designs.

    Since this was a test in only select stores, we created an experience where customers signed
    in to ensure they saw current prices and coupons. When coming to the site for the first time,
    customers were walked through the most important elements of the site to ensure they had the
    best experience possible.

<p>
    From the homepage, you can browse through the recipes as well as see which recipes have
    associated sales and coupons. Customers could also add recipes/ingredients straight to a
    shopping list to make shopping a breeze.
