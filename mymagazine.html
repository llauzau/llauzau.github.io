    MyMagazine™ is Kroger’s flagship best customers communication. Filled with seasonal articles and recipes curated to
    fit each customer’s interests and shopping patterns. MyMagazine™ is both a print and digital publication that is
    sent to roughly 4 million customers between the two mediums.

    Each issue had a small team made up of copy writers, designers and QA. The team was responsible for the creation of
    the mailer from start to finish. Everything from the color palette and content creation to planning and directing
    photoshoots for all of the photography and videos in the issue.

    I was part of the team that developed the initial digital version of MyMagazine™, working with a cross-functional
    team of designers and developers to create a seamless digital experience for customers from opening their email
    through clipping and redeeming their coupons.

    As an art director at 84.51°, MyMagazine™ was just a piece of what I worked on. Curated mailers for Kroger Family of
    Brands, Private Selection, Simple Truth, Pharmacy and more. With the customer at the heart of every project, unique
    versions were created to ensure everything we created was curated for each customers needs.
