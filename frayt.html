<h2 class="u-push__top--xl">The Problem</h2>
<p>
    As with most start-ups, Fray built their initial app on a platform designed for prototyping while verifying
    it's business model. But, when product usage soared, their low-code system struggled to scale along with it.
    In addition to needing to transition their customer-facing Driver & Shipper apps with minimal downtime, they also
    needed to overhaul their administrative tool to allow their operators to keep up with real-time insights. Our team
    was tasked with rewriting the customer-facing apps in a way that would be scalable with Frayt’s continuously growing
    user base, while simultaneously building a new admin interface that leveraged technology for a real-time data
    updates.

<h2>Design Process</h2>
<h3>Discovery</h3>
<p>
    Since Frayt's existing Driver & Shipper apps had already been validated and the UI was not going to change with the
    rewrite, we focused primarily on the admin interface during discovery. We started by doing a deep-dive of the
    existing Driver & Shipper apps in order to understand the features and functionality included. We then conducted
    interviews with operators, sales, and the CFO, who would all be users of the admin interface to identify what
    features the app needed to include.
</p>
<h3>Team & Role </h3>
<p>
    I was team lead and primary designer on this project. As team lead, I was responsible
    for managing the budget, leading conversations with the client, and prioritizing work.
    As the designer, I coordinated and led all facets of the admin design including: user
    flows, UX/UI design, and HTML & CSS implementation.
</p>
<h3>User Interface Design</h3>
<p>
    The interface throughout the app is very clean and minimal with accents of color. We wanted to focus the user on the
    information in the tables­, which were used as often as possible to ensure the operators can view as much
    information about the active jobs as possible without becoming overwhelmed. The colors align with their brand and
    help highlight key client statistics and team goals.
