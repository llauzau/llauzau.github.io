<h1>Hi, I'm Lauren!</h1>
<div class="main__about">
    <div>
        <p>
            I'm a designer, font-end developer, and mom of three.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe that good design can be both functional and beautiful. I think designers have the power
            to push for new ideas and should always be an advocate for the user.
        </p>
        <p>
            I started my career as a full-time print designer, but kept finding myself gravitating toward projects that
            were multi-media. I enjoy trying to figure out how things work and solving complex problems. I've spent the
            last 3.5 years figuring out how to not only create nice UX/UI experiences, but also how to make them work.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a mom of three, life is never dull. I enjoy spending time with my family and try to get outside
            as often as possible. When I'm not working, I can often be found gardening, hiking or biking or
            traveling to one of the coutries National Parks.
        </p>
