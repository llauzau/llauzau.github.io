#### Art Director

_July 2017 – Present_

As an art director I am responsible for both daily design on more complex projects within the department as well as new product development. Some things I have done are:     
- Collaborated on re-designing the MyMagazine website while leading user-testing for the site.
- Worked closely with the developers on the re-design of the MyMagazine website as well as Kroger’s $10Table website.
- Created the look, tone and feel on a new Pharmacy program that helps customers start their journey to healthier lifestyles.
- Direct photo shoots for my projects as well as helping manage  other team members photo shoots. 
- Worked with Salesforce and Kroger’s Digital team to create email templates for Kroger’s Best-Customer Communications.


#### Senior Designer

_April 2015 – July 2017_

Kroger purchased the Kroger portion of the dunnhumby business and my position shifted to the new company. My role became solely focused on the Kroger business. Project complexity drastically increased to achieve a higher level of customer personalization. This lead to more variable content and layout creation.

- Collaborated on projects with designers and copy writers on the team to create content and layouts that are personalized for Kroger shoppers.
- Direct photo shoots for my projects.
